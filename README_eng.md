# Practice code for "Neural Networks and Deep Learning"

[ä¸­æ–‡ç‰ˆ](./README.md) | English

Codes are based on [the book author's codes](https://github.com/mnielsen/neural-networks-and-deep-learning) and [DeepLearningPython35](https://github.com/MichalDanielDobrzanski/DeepLearningPython35) for adjustments to run in python3. There are few differencesðŸŒš.(My codes must be worseðŸ™ˆ)

I don't want to use other people's codes directly. So I wrote these codes by myself basing on code samples of the book, to help me understand the book.ðŸ¤£

## Details of my codes

Network.py is based on the book. According to the author's question, I improved it to train all data as a matrix in a mini_batch in one time, rather than train data one after another, to speed the training.

Network2.py is based on the book and uses the matrix improvement in network.py.(Because I haven't use git in command line for a long time, I use `git checkout -- network2.py` carelessly. I don't know what changes have been discard, soâ€¦â€¦I choose to give up it and wouldn't try to restore those changes.ðŸ˜­)

Network3.pyâ€¦â€¦emmm, I don't want to write it because I am lazy to install Theano.
